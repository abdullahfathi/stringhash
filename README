This software is designed for string similarity search with edit distance constraint. Please refer to our paper "String Similarity Search: A Hash-Based Approach" for more details (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8051071/).

The software can be run as followed,
./stringsim <filename> -q [q] -tau [tau] -k [k] -query [queryfilename]

For example,
./stringsim ../stringdata/MovieReview.txt -q 3 -tau 24 -k 30 -query ../stringdata/MovieReview.txt.24_query

Every line is treated as an input string in both the input file and the query file.

To compile the code for generating the XX label, set the CPPFLAGS in the makefile as CPPFLAGS= -c -m64 -march=native -std=c++14 -DGCC -DRelease -O3.
To compile the code for generating the OX label, set the CPPFLAGS in the makefile as CPPFLAGS= -c -m64 -march=native -std=c++14 -DGCC -DRelease -O3 -DOXLABEL.

Tested on Linux system using GCC 5.4.0.

Please cite our paper if the software is used for research works.
